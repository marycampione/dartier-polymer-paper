dartier_polymer_paper
=====================

This is a translation of the Polymer/JS app used in the PolymerJS tutorial, which you can view here: https://www.polymer-project.org/docs/start/tutorial/intro.html. This translation uses more Dart constructs than the straight translation.

Two other versions are available:

* A straight translation of the PolymerJS tutorial app:  https://github.com/marycampione/polymer_paper_example
* A version that has been divided into steps matching the PolymerJS tutorial steps: https://github.com/marycampione/polymer_app_with_steps/tree/master

Have fun!
